## Introduction
AMAAS (Automated Mobile Accessibility Assessment System) is an innovative approach combining cognitive mapping with automated mobile application accessibility scoring. This project, implemented in Python, facilitates accessibility evaluations and is runnable within PyCharm.

## Steps:

1.  Utilize the automated testing tool, Fastbot, to procure logs containing actions for each step and corresponding XML files of the respective pages.
2.  Update folder addresses and their corresponding file addresses as necessary.
3.  Execute **data_processing.py**.
4.  Metrics and scores for each app will be stored in **evaluation.xlsx**.
5.  Note that: The entropy weighting method requires a certain base number of apps to get the final score, and a single app cannot directly calculate the score, so 4-5 apps need to be tested.
